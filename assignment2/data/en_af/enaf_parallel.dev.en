What is a school governing body (SGB)?
An SGB is a structure that governs the school.
It stands in a position of trust towards the school.
It is made up of the principal, elected representatives of educators, non-educator staff, parents and learners, in the case of secondary schools.
The SGB can also select persons in the community who have special skills to be non-voting members of the SGB.
How do I get elected to represent other parents on the governing body?
You can represent other parents on a governing body if you are nominated and voted for by parents.
The SGB is elected for a three-year period.
You can stand at the next election.
As soon as your last child leaves the school, you must resign your seat, as you no longer have any rights on the SGB.
Parents can be re-elected as long as they have children in the school.
How do I get to know about the election process?
The principal/SGB of the school is required by law to provide all parents with information about the election of parents onto the governing body.
You should vote in each SGB election.
What happens if I'm not elected onto the school governing body?
Even if you are not elected onto the school governing body, you should support the school's SGB in its work and you must respond to written notices calling for a response.
You have the RIGHT to be involved in the affairs of the school through attending meetings of parents or other meetings organised by the school, including the SGB's Annual General Meeting.
The school must give you at least 30 days notice before this meeting is to be held.
At this meeting the SGB must present its budget and annual financial report.
The school must present a report concerning its activities at least once a year.
You also have the RIGHT to be consulted by the educators or the principal about the schooling activities of our child.
The principal and the educators at the school must notify you in good time and regularly about the well-being, behaviour, attendance and learning progress of you child.
You must also be informed and represent your child at any disciplinary proceedings against your child in terms of the school's Code of Conduct.
Who makes the decision about school matters?
The Head of the Provincial Education Department, through the principal, takes all decisions about education in the school.
You should be informed about these decisions and have the right to information concerning the school and your child's education.
Your school must also have a Code of Conduct.
You have the right to be consulted regarding the preparation and amendment of the Code of Conduct.
Where can I lodge an objection against a decision or action?
You can lodge an objection against a decision or action of:
* an educator, with the principal;
* a principal, with the Head of the Education Department in the province;
* a representative council of learners member, with the school governing body; and,

Language of Learning and Teaching
* What does the Language-in-Education Policy say?
* Will my child not be disadvantaged by being taught in a language other than English?
* Who decides on the language of learning and teaching?
* Does my child have options regarding the language of learning and teaching in a school?
What does the Language-in-Education Policy say?
The Department's Language-in-Education Policy encourages learners to learn more that one language.
It also encourages them to use the language that they best understand as the language of learning and teaching.
They can learn other languages as subjects or add other languages as languages of instruction.
Will my child not be disadvantaged by being taught in a language other than English?
Learning through the home language during the first years of formal schooling ensures a solid foundation for future learning, as well as the acquisition of new/other languages.
Who decides on the language of learning and teaching?
The SGB must decide on the language of learning and teaching used in a school.
The language used will depend on the preference of the majority of learners in the school and the ability of the school to teach in the preferred language.
In addition, the SGB needs to indicate how it will promote multilingualism in the school.
Does my child have options regarding the language of learning and teaching in a school?
Each learner must, upon registration at a school, indicate the preferred language of learning and teaching.
Any of our 11 languages may be indicated as the language of learning and teaching in a public school.
Where there are more than 30 children requesting a particular language, the school must make an effort to offer tuition in that language.

* Code of Conduct
* Corporal Punishment and Alternative Punishments
* Suspension & Expulsion
CODE OF CONDUCT
The governing body at each school must consult with educators, parents and learners to draft a code of conduct for learners.
This code of conduct must include:
* the types of misbehaviour that will be punished.
* the types of punishment that will be given for different forms of misbehaviour.
* procedure that the school will follow in disciplining a learner.
* grievance procedures for parents and learners if they want to take up a matter against another learner or the school.
A guide on how to establish a code of conduct is contained in the document Alternatives to Corporal Punishment
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND ALTERNATIVE PUNISHMENTS
Corporal punishment, e.g. caning, is prohibited in schools, and anyone found using it can be charged with assault.
To assist teachers find alternative means of disciplining children, the national Department of Education has released a document on alternative means of disciplining learners.
Parents who become aware of corporal punishment in a school should approach the principal and thereafter the school's Circuit Manager, who can be contacted via the nearest EMDC.
Learners who want to report corporal punishment anonymously can contact the Safe Schools Call Centre toll-free on 0800 45 46 47.
SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT
The regulations governing cases of serious misconduct are set out in Provincial Gazette Extraordinary 5190 of 31 October 1997.
These regulations specify the kinds of misconduct defined as serious (e.g. possession or use of liquor or drugs, assault, theft, immorality, absenteeism and disgraceful conduct).
A list of forms of serious misconduct is given in the Department of Education document Alternatives to Corporal Punishment.
A governing body can suspend a learner from school for up to a week for serious misconduct.
If the governing body finds the offence serious enough, it can recommend to the provincial Head of Education that he or she should expel the learner.
The Head of Education must decide on the matter within 14 days, during which time the learner may not attend school.
If a learner is expelled, he or she (and/or parents) can appeal to the provincial Minister of Education.
If an expelled learner is of compulsory school-going age, the Head of Education has to make arrangements to place him or her in another public school.

Questions and Answers about Measles & Polio Immunisation
This publication provides information for parents around measles and polio vaccinations.
Stop Polio!
Stop Measles!
Immunise!
MEASLES
What is Measles?
Measles is the most dangerous of all childhood diseases.
The first sign is a high fever followed by a blotchy red rash all over the body.
It is also accompanied by cough, a runny nose and red eyes.
Measles can cause dangerous complications, such as infection of the lungs, blindness and death.
What causes measles?
Measles is caused by a very small germ called the measles virus.
It cannot by seen with the naked eye.
It is spread when a child with measles coughs or sneezes.
Children who suffered from measles cannot get it a second time.
Most children who have been immunised against measles at the right age will not get measles.
Why is measles a dangerous disease?
Young children, who survive measles are weakened by the disease and may later die from malnutrition or other illnesses.
Measles is also an important cause of mental retardation and blindness.
A quarter of all deaths from measles occur before the age of one year.
Measles in older children usually occur as outbreaks, when large groups of children get measles at the same time.
The risk of a measles outbreak is higher when groups of children gather together for example in crèches day care centres and at schools.
Is it important to immunise children during the measles campaign?
Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the EXTRA measles injection during the campaign.
Children who miss the immunisation campaign might not be fully protected against the measles virus.
I heard that the parents or guardians of children must sign a consent form before a child can receive the extra measles immunisation.
Is it true?
If a child is to be immunised at a school or crèche where the parent is not present when the immunisation is given, a consent form will be given to parents or guardians of children in crèches, day care centres and at schools in advance.
It provides and opportunity to inform parents or guardians about the extra measles injection.
In this case, if you agree to this immunisation, please complete and sign the form and send it back to the school or crèche.
Your child will then receive the immunisation if consent forms are signed and returned on time!
If you bring the child to an immunisation centre during the campaign, it is not necessary for you to fill in a consent form.
POLIO
What is Polio?
Polio is a crippling disease.
It is caused by a very small germ called the polio virus.
Polio can lead to permanent lameness, deformity and even death.
Due to routine immunisations in childhood, polio has not been seen in South Africa since 1989.
However, there have been outbreaks of polio in neighbouring countries.
How will I recognize polio in a child?
Polio can be suspected when there is sudden weakness of the leg or arm or both or other parts of the body.
This weakness should not have been present at birth.
If the person was injured just before the weakness of the person has a history of being mentally retarded, then polio is not likely to be the cause of the weakness.
Please report any sudden weakness/paralysis in a child under 15 years (not caused by injury), to the nearest clinic, hospital or doctor for investigation.
It could be polio!
Why do we have special campaigns to immunise against polio?
To give TWO extra polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.
This prevents the polio virus from circulating among children.
South Africa is taking part in an effort to eradicate polio worldwide.
It means that the virus will be wiped out completely from the face of the earth,.
Once the polio virus does not exist any more, children will no longer need to receive polio immunisation.
Is it important to immunise children during the first and second round of the polio campaign?
Yes - It is IMPORTANT to bring children for the first AND the second round of the polio campaign - even if the child is up to date with the routine immunisations.
To protect children against the polio virus, polio drops need to be given TWICE.
Children who miss the second round will not be fully protected against the polio virus.
Nationwide, starting dates for the campaigns in 2004 will be 26 July (measles and polio); and 30 August (polio only).
The duration of the campaigns will differ from province to province.
Why do we have Measles and Polio Immunisation campaigns?
To give extra measles and polio immunisations to as many children as possible, at the SAME TIME.
This prevents the measles and polio virus from circulating among children.
Why is the extra measles and polio immunisation for certain age groups only?
The children aged under 5 years are the group of children who most often become ill with measles and polio and spread the virus.
Is the extra measles and polio immunisation only for children who missed their routine immunisations?
No!
All children aged between 0 months to under 5 years must receive the EXTRA campaign immunisations.
Where must I go to make sure that my child does not miss the extra immunisations?
Talk to your clinic nurse, community leaders and employers about the campaign.
Look out for immunisation posters and radio announcements that will indicate the way to the nearest immunisation post.
Special efforts will be made to bring immunisation posts as close to your home as possible during the campaign.
You can also go to your nearest clinic.
Immunisation teams will visit day care centres, crèches and schools during the campaign.
Must I bring my child's immunisation card?
Yes, please bring it along.
It is always important to take the child's and your own immunisation card with you when you go to a clinic or doctor.
Cards may be checked during one of the rounds to see if a child needs routine immunisations.
But even if your child has lost his/her card or has never had a card, please still bring your child to be immunised.
What will I find at the immunisation post?
You will be asked if the child is in the age group.
While holding your child, 2 drops will be given to the child and it will be given again if your child spits it out.
The extra measles injection will be given to children from 9 months to under 5 years of age, on the same day with the polio drops.
Can a sick child get immunisations?
Yes, all children can be given the immunisations even if they have fever, cough, diarrhoea, malnutrition or any other illness.
If you would like to help eliminate measles and eradicate polio out of South Africa, here is how you can assist or become involved.
* Contact your nearest clinic and speak to them.
A clinic nurse will be in charge at the immunisation post during the campaign.
Tasks will be delegated to VOLUNTEERS.
* Tell everybody about the campaign and to bring all the children.
The measles and polio immunisation campaigns are opportunities to contribute to the well being of your children and their future!

Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is Credit?
What Is Credit?
Credit refers to an arrangement where you buy goods and pay for them after you have taken possession of them.
Often you pay off the item in instalments over a period of time.
Examples of credit include:
* accounts at shops (for example, an account at a clothing store)
* accounts at professional service providers (for example, an account at the doctor)
* lease agreements or instalment sale agreements (for example, where you agree to pay for an item over a period of time, like at a furniture store – these used to be called hire-purchase agreements).
You can also get credit from a bank or a micro-lender.
In this case, you are given a cash loan.
You are required to pay back the loan over an agreed period of time.
You are also required to pay interest on the loan.
It is important to note that, when you buy on credit, you are likely to pay more than if you paid for the goods in cash.
To make sure that you know how much you will actually pay if you buy on credit find out:
* the cash price and the extra costs
* what the total amount will be
* how much the deposit is
* what the monthly payments will be
* how long you can take to pay off the amount.
CONTENTS: Credit and Loans
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Agreement?
What Is a Credit Agreement?
When you buy something on credit, you will have to sign a credit agreement.
This is a legal contract and must include the following information:
* The names and addresses of the buyer and seller.
* A description of the goods.
* The cash price and the other charges (finance charges, insurance and so on) that make up the total price the buyer must pay.
The rate of interest applicable must also be included.
* The deposit that must be paid (a deposit must be paid).
* The amount of each instalment, including the last instalment, and the day of the week or month by which it must be paid.
* A note informing the buyer that the seller continues to own the goods until the full price has been paid.
You must be given a copy of the credit agreement.
You should keep this document in a safe place.
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What is Micro-Finance?
What is Micro-Finance?
Micro finance is a broad term used to describe money lending on a small scale.
Registered Lenders
Micro-lenders are encouraged to register with the Micro Finance Regulatory Council (MFRC).
The MFRC is an independent, non-profit organisation that has been empowered by government to regulate the micro-lending industry and protect the interests of consumers.
All lenders registered with the MFRC should have a registration certificate displayed at their business.
Micro-lenders registered with the MFRC operate under different rules to lenders who are not registered.
Most importantly, they qualify for the exemption in terms of the Usury Act which means they may charge you any interest rate.
For services, advice and information, visit the MFRC website.
Information includes details on:
* rights
* unfair practices
* registered lenders
* complaints.
You can also contact them at
Toll-share: 0860 100 406
info@mfrc.co.za or complaints@mfrc.co.za
Unregistered Lenders
Micro-lenders who are not registered with the MFRC, are regulated by the Usury Act.
This Act prevents lenders from charging excessive interest rates.
These rates vary from time to time and the rate applicable depends on the date the loan agreement was entered into.
Currently, these lenders cannot charge interest of more than 23% per year on a loan of less than R10,000, and cannot charge interest of more than 20% per year on a loan of more than R10,000.
Unregistered lenders are controlled by the Department of Trade and Industry and can lend you an amount of up to R50,000.
Your agreement will set out how long you have to pay back the loan.
You can only cancel a contract with an unregistered lender if you and the lender agreed to this before you signed the contract.
If you want to complain about an unregistered lender, you can contact the National Inspectorate of Consumer Affairs at 011 355 8008.
Tips
* You have three days in which to cancel a micro-loan agreement with a registered micro-lender, if you change your mind.
* Get a written contract setting out all costs and charges.
* Lenders must use legal mechanisms for collecting loans.
The lender is not allowed to:
* ask to keep your bank card
* ask for your bank card number (PIN number)
* ask you to leave your ID book with him
* ask you to leave a grant payment card
* ask you to sign blank documents or documents with blank spaces
* use violent means to collect the money owed.
* No lender should charge an up-front fee with the application, in other words, a fee when you sign the agreement.
* Do not sign a ‘Consent to judgement’ when you take a loan.
* You have a right to ask for a statement at any time showing how much you have paid and how much you still owe.
* You must also receive your copy of the contract within 14 days of signing it.
Grants and Micro-Lending
You cannot use a social grant (for example a pension or child care grant) as surety for a loan.
Lenders are not allowed to hold onto your grants payment card, as security for a loan.
If you are a recipient of a social grant, you will be required to sign a declaration saying that you will keep your grants payment card (also called an Allpay Card) safe and will not give it to a micro lender.
Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt What Is a Credit Profile?
What Is a Credit Profile?
Your credit profile contains your personal details, where and how many times you've applied for credit, as well as information on your paying habits.
Whenever you apply for credit, the creditor will check your profile and decide whether to give you credit based on the information they receive from the credit bureau.
If you have a bad credit history, it impacts on your credit profile for years to come.
Different credit problems are kept on record for different lengths of time:
* liquidations & sequestrations - ten years
* court judgments against you - five years
* negative records (eg unpaid accounts) - three years
* collection records and administration orders - until the debt is settled.
When you apply for credit, the creditor will check your credit rating with the credit bureau, and if you have a bad credit history, they will refuse to give you credit.
This is referred to as "black listing".
You can get your credit profiles from the major credit bureaus for a fee (the fees depend on the information you are requesting).
The credit bureau will be able to answer your questions about your credit rating, and whether there is anything you can do to improve your rating.
There are two major credit bureaux in South Africa:

Home > Publications > Public Information > K > Credit and Loans &gt When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?
When Can the Creditor Repossess My Goods?
If you buy on credit, the creditor usually remains the owner of the things you have bought until you have finished paying all the instalments.
This means that if you can't pay your monthly instalments, the creditor can repossess the items in question.
Unless the creditor has a court order, they can only repossess the item if they have your permission (this is called "voluntary surrender").
If the creditor wants to force you to return the items, then they will need a court order.
Before they can get this order, the creditor must send a registered letter to you warning you that the payments are overdue and that the outstanding amount must be paid within 30 days.
If you have previously fallen behind in your payments and received a letter of demand, and you fall behind again, the creditor will send a letter of demand giving you 14 days to pay the outstanding instalments.
If you still do not pay, then the seller can get a court order to repossess the goods.
If you are presented with a court summons, you will have to enter a written plea at the court, or file an opposing affidavit, explaining why you have not paid the amount (for example, the creditor may be claiming more from you than you actually owe).
Matters are usually settled without a trial, but if the matter is not settled and you want to go to court to defend yourself, you need to file a Notice of Intention to Defend.
If the matter goes to trial and you do not defend yourself or if the court thinks that you are not justified, the court can issue an order allowing the creditor to reclaim the goods.
The Sheriff of the court is responsible for repossessing the goods.
This official will show you the court order and can then take the goods away.
If the sheriff has a court order, then you (or anyone else staying in the house at the time) must allow them into the house to take the goods away.
Sometimes, the creditor will not want the goods back and will issue a summons against you to get the money back.
In this case, the creditor will have to explain why they can't reclaim the goods.
Will the instalments you have already paid be refunded if the goods are repossessed?
The value of the goods is likely to have diminished since you first bought them because they are no longer brand new.
Depending on the value of the repossessed goods, you may get a refund (if the value of the goods plus the amount you have already paid is more than what you originally owed, then you will be paid the difference).
But if the goods are worth less then the amount that you still owe, then you will still owe the creditor money.
If someone (like a debt recovery agent) has been sent to claim a debt from you and has behaved inappropriately, you can lodge a complaint with the Council for Debt Collectors (all debt collectors must be registered with the council).

Employ People with Disabilities
AUTHOR: Chief Directorate of Communications for the Directorate of Equal Opportunities
This publication provides information about employment of people with disabilities to employers and employees.
"It's time to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity"
* Aim of the Code
* Definition of "People with Disabilities"
* Reasonable Accommodate the Needs of People with Disabilities
* Recruitment and Selection of People with Disabilities
* Medical and Psychological Testing
* Training and Career Advancement
* Retaining People with Disabilities
* Compensation for with Disabilities
* Confidentiality
* Benefits for Staff Members
* Employment Equity Planning
* Education and Awareness
* Information
Many barriers such as widespread ignorance, fear and stereotypes have caused people with disabilities to be unfairly discriminated against in society and in employment.
For these reasons they are a designated group in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.
The Minister of Labour has therefore approved a Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities in terms of the Employment Equity Act, 1998.
AIM OF THE CODE
The Code is a guide for employers and workers to encourage equal opportunities and fair treatment of people with disabilities as required by the Act.
The Code is intended to educate and inform employers and workers to understand their rights and obligations to promote certainty and to reduce disputes so that people with disabilities can effectively enjoy and exercise their rights at work.
The Code is intended to help create awareness of the contributions people with disabilities can make and to encourage employers to fully use the skills of such people.
DEFINITION OF "PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES"
In terms of the Act the focus is on the effect of a disability on the person in relation to the working environment, and not on the diagnosis or the impairment.
People are considered as "People with Disabilities" who satisfy all the criteria in the definition:
* having a physical or mental impairment
* which is long term or recurring, and
* which substantially limits their prospects of entry into or advancement in employment.
REASONABLY ACCOMODATE THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Employers should adopt the most cost-effective mean that is consistent with effectively removing the barriers to perform the job, and to enjoy equal access to the benefits and opportunities of employment.
Reasonable accommodation applies to applicants and staff members with disabilities who are suitably qualified for the job and may be required:
* during the recruitment and selection process
* in the working environment
* in the way work is usually done, evaluated and rewarded
* in the benefits and privileges of employment.
RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Employers should make job advertisements accessible to people with disabilities by identifying the inherent requirements of the post, clearly describing the skills and capabilities required and setting reasonable criteria for selection.
MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING
Tests should comply with the requirements of the Act and must be relevant and appropriate to the work for which the person is being tested.
Employers should ensure that tests do not unfairly exclude conditions and should not be biased on how or when they are applied, assessed or interpreted.
Testing to determine the health status of a person should only be carried out after the employer has established that the person is in fact competent to perform the essential job functions or duties and after a job offer has been made.
TRAINING AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT
People with disabilities should be consulted on their career advancement and possible needs and so facilities and materials for training should be accessible to them.
Evaluation of work performance should clearly identify and fairly measure and reward performance of the essential functions of the job.
RETAINING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Workers who become disabled during employment should, where reasonably possible, be re-integrated into the work force.
IF reasonable, employers should explore the possibility of offering alternative work, reduced work or flexible work placement, so that workers are not compelled or encouraged to terminate their employment.
COMPENSATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
When workers become disabled because of work related illnesses or accidents, the employer should assist that worker to receive the relevant assistance in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injures and Diseases Act from the Compensation Fund and to receive the appropriate benefits in terms of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Employers must protect the confidentiality of information that has been disclosed by a worker or job applicant with a disability.
They must take care to keep records of private information relating to the disability confidential and separate from general personal records.
Employers may not disclose any information relating to a person's disability without the written consent of the person concerned, unless required to do so by law.
BENEFITS FOR STAFF MEMBERS
Employers who provide or arrange for occupational insurance or other benefit plans for workers must ensure that the benefits do not unfairly discriminate, either directly or indirectly against people with disabilities.
EMPLOYMENT EQUITY PLANNING
If people with disabilities are under-represented in all occupational levels and categories in the workplace, the employer should seek guidance from organisations that represent people with disabilities or relevant experts, for example in vocational rehabilitation and occupational therapy to bring those vacancies to the attention of possible work seekers with disabilities.
EDUCATION AND AWARENESS
Employers, employer organisations and trade unions should include the Code in orientation, education and training programmes of workers.
For more information consult the Employment Equity Act, 1998 and the Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities on the website of the Department of Labour at www.labour.gov.za or contact the CCMA helpline at 0861 161616 or the nearest office of the Department of Labour.

Cape Town and Surrounds
The city was once bursting with slaves - they were artisans, builders, coopers, bakers, cleaners, fruit and fish vendors, water carriers, grave-diggers, potters, wood collectors, gardeners and wetnurses.
An estimated 63 000 slaves were imported between the mid-17th century and the early 19th century from Indonesia, India, Ceylon, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Angola and Mozambique.

Van Riebeeck's Fort de Goede Hoop was situated where the Parade is today.
This is where slaves were first housed.
The Slave Lodge (49 Adderley Street) In 1679 a windowless, brick structure was built to house the slaves of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC).
The building's dilapidated and filthy state was reported throughout the 18th century.
Besides serving as a labour force for the Company, slaves also worked in the adjacent gardens, as well as in the hospital opposite the lodge.

The Slave Tree Plaque
The Slave Tree plaque (Spin Street) This commemorative plaque on the centre island marks the site where the Slave Tree - the place where slaves were auctioned - once stood.
Justitie plaats and Whipping Post The south-western corner of Darling and Buitenkant Streets was once a place of torture and execution.
There was a post to which slaves and convicted persons were tied while receiving corporal punishment.
The Company's Garden One of the many gardens worked by Company slaves is at the top of Adderley Street.
The others were at Rustenburg, Groote Schuur, Newlands, Fish Hoek and Simon's Town.
By 1782 almost two thirds of the inhabitants of the outposts (of which the gardens formed a part) were slaves.
There is a symbolic slave bell (not from this period) in the Company's Garden.
Bells like this were used on farms to call slaves to work.
The Company Gardens
Green Market Square
Slave Pricing Auction
Greenmarket Square and the Old Town House Fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables grown in the gardens of Table Valley, as well as produce brought in by farmers from the outlying districts, were sold here by slaves earning their "coolie money" (derogatory term used for slave earnings).
The slaves used a tavern next to the Old Town House for drinking and gambling.
There was also a fountain on the square from which slaves fetched water.

Platteklip Stream
Leeuwenhof (Hof Street) The official residence of the Premier of the Western Cape has an outbuilding dating back to the 18th century that was used as a slave lodge.
Other residences in upper Table Valley also had lodges to house the slaves who worked their commercial gardens, although none of these lodges have survived.
Leeuwenhof's slave lodge now houses an exhibition on the history of the estate, which is open to the public by appointment.

Platteklip stream on Table Mountain This is where household slaves came to do the laundry.
Old Slave Church, SA Mission Museum (40 Long Street) The South African Missionary Society, an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, was founded in 1799 by Reverend Vos of Tulbagh to spread Christianity to slaves.
This architecturally unique church was built in 1804.
Today it is a museum depicting the history of South African Christian mission work.
Other mission and post-emancipation sites with slave connections are St Stephen's Church in Riebeeck Square, the church in Chapel Street and the Berlin Mission in Searle Street, District Six.
Many ex-slave baptisms and marriages also took place in the Lutheran Church in Strand Street.
On 1 December 1838, the day of the emancipation, a service of thanksgiving took place at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Somerset Road).
Until the ex-slave component of the congregation moved to St Stephen's Church (then the Old Theatre) they were accommodated at St Andrew's.
Tel: 021 423 6755
St Stephen's Church (Riebeeck Square) This building dates from 1801.
It was originally a theatre open to all races but in 1829 slaves and free blacks were no longer allowed to attend.
Ironically, this theatre was later used as a mission church for freed slaves.
This caused a public outcry and the windows of the church were shattered by stone-throwing ex-theatre patrons.
Because of this, the church was named after the martyr St Stephen, who was stoned to death.
It is unusual in the Dutch Reformed Church to name a parish after a martyr.
St Andrew's Church
Old Slave Church
Auwal Mosque (39 Dorp Street) The Muslim faith was brought to South Africa by slaves imported from the East.
This mosque's history dates back to 1794.
The property was owned by a freed slave, Salie Coridon of Ceylon.
His daughter married Achmat of Bengal, who later inherited the property and subsequently made it available to the Muslim community to be used as a mosque.
It is the oldest mosque in the country.
Palm Tree Mosque (Long Street) It was built in the 1780s as a house with a prayer room upstairs and the Imam's residence downstairs.
The Muslim congregation of the Palm Tree Mosque has an oral tradition which says that the house was given as a mosque to the Imam by his son-in-law, Jan Boekies.
Unmarked graves (Somerset Road, Green Point) Slaves and paupers were buried in an unmarked burial ground at the lower end of Signal Hill (where the Green Point Traffic Department is today), as well as in the Coburn Street area.
Bo-Kaap and Tana Baru cemetery The Bo-Kaap is inhabited mainly by descendants of slaves who were brought here by the VOC in the early days of the settlement.
This area is characterised by narrow, cobblestone streets and mosques.
Many of the flat-roofed houses date back to the 18th century.
The Bo-Kaap Museum (71 Wale Street) is furnished as a 19th century Muslim home.
Many slaves were Muslim and were buried above the Bo-Kaap.
The burial ground has a magnificent view of the city.Tel: 021 481 39393
Hurling Swinging Pump (Prins Street) There was no piped water in Cape Town and slaves were sent to fetch water from public fountains or wells like this one.

Groot Constantia (Constantia Road, Constantia) The farm Constantia was granted to Governor Simon van der Stel in 1685.
In 1692 he built a U-shaped house on the property.
Constantia wines were well-known in the 18th century and competed with Madeira wine in Europe.
Lady Ann Barnard watched wine being made here in 1798 by slaves "who were dancing in the wine press and beating the drum" and the slaves danced on them softly, the wine running out from a hole at the bottom of the barrel, this was done to slow music...".
At Groot Constantia a few of the slaves were musicians.
Today the house and outbuildings function as a museum containing furniture and porcelain from the VOC period.
Slaves were housed in a building next to the Jonkershuis (a separate building near the main house).
Anna de Koning, the daughter of a freed slave, inherited Groot Constantia from her husband, Oloff Bergh.
She owned 27 slaves.
Tel: 021 795 5140
Old Residency, Simon's Town Museum (Court Road) The museum has close connections with a few of the local families in the area who have done genealogical research on their slave ancestors, many of whom were Muslims.
Some families have kitaabs or diaries going back to slave times.
In the basement of the former Residency there are cells where criminals and slaves were imprisoned.
There is also a Muslim Heritage Museum in King George Way.

Vergelegen (Lourensford Road, Somerset West) This is a working wine estate with an old house, outbuildings and a slave lodge.
In about 1700 Willem Adriaan van der Stel erected an outbuilding that resembled a 17th century European hallehuis - a large three-aisled barn-like structure with a thatched roof reaching almost to the ground.
The slave lodge housed up to 200 slaves at a time.
The slaves at Vergelegen worked as cabinet-makers, tailors, cooks, masons and labourers.
The lodge was excavated for the Anglo-American De Beers Chairman's Educational Trust in 1989.
The remains of a slave woman were discovered under the floor of the site.
She was re-buried on the farm in a marked grave, which can be visited.
There is an interpretive centre on the farm where artefacts recovered during archaeological excavation are displayed.

Slaves were the backbone of the colonial economy.
They outnumbered Europeans, yet it is all but forgotten who built and maintained public buildings and roads in the colony, who did the back-breaking work in the vineyards and orchards of Boland farms, who helped to build the imposing homesteads and who made furniture, vats, wagons, clothes and other forms of cultural material that we still see around us today.
Slave sales were held on farms and auctions took place in Stellenbosch.
Slaves were punished and executed in Stellenbosch in public, as well as in the Old Goal.
Arson, one of the most frequent transgressions, was punishable by hanging.

Rhenish Mission Church (on the Braak) The Stellenbosche Medewerkende Zendelings Genoodschap was established in 1801, and the name changed to Het Stellenbosche Zendelings Genoodschap in 1838.
The society was concerned with the spiritual and educational needs of slaves.
The first missionary and teacher was Meeuwes Janse Bakker and meetings were held at his house.
Reverend Erasmus Smit took over in 1822.
A church was built on a donated plot of ground and dedicated in 1824.
After 1829 the Rhenish missionary Luckhoff worked among slaves on neighbouring farms and started evening schools for them.
The congregation joined the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa in 1948 but kept the name of the Rhenish Dutch Reformed Mission Congregation.
Row of slave houses in Herte Street The Rhenish Mission Church provided a row of houses for freed slaves in Herte Street.
A painting of the family can still be seen hanging in Bletterman House.
The long building on the corner of Plein and Ryneveld streets was originally the slave quarters of Bletterman House.
From 1825 to 1833 it served as a school for slave children under Reverend Erasmus Smit and was equipped with 50 benches.
Since boys and girls were taught separately, a wooden partition was installed between them.
At first the school had 73 pupils, but by 1824 numbers had risen to 124 pupils.
When the school closed, the children were accommodated at the Rhenish Mission Church.
Slaves were also once housed in the western half of the cottage of Grosvenor House (today it is Collins Cottage).
Tel: 021 887 2937
Kromme Rivier (Paul Kruger Street) This estate was granted as a farm to Jan Jansz van Eeden in 1683.
Many structures were erected on this farm during its history, including a 1730's building where slaves are presumed to have been housed.
It was changed considerably over time and today it is a double-storeyed flat.
The property belongs to the Roman Catholic Church and is known as St Nicholas Roman Catholic Priory.

Elsenburg (on the R304) In 1752 Martin Melck became the owner of the farm.
He was also one of the biggest slave owners at the Cape, having 200 slaves at his command.
In his time the farmhouse, slave quarters, outbuildings and a school for slave children were erected.
On smaller farms there were no special living quarters for slaves; they slept in kitchens, attics and barns, or out of doors in summer.
A story exists about Moses of Bengal, a slave from Elsenburg who was sold to the owner of Loevenstein in Parow.
He was mistreated by his new owner and ran back to Elsenburg where he set the slave lodge alight.
His punishment was that he was burned alive.
The old house, outbuildings and slave bell have survived and form part of the Elsenburg College of Agriculture campus.
It is open to the public.

Lanzerac (Jonkershoek Road) Lanzerac, originally known as Schoongezigt, was granted partly to free blacks Manuel and Anthony of Angola, and Louis of Bengal, in 1692.
Interestingly, they also owned slaves.
Other free blacks settled in what is today known as Jonkershoek.
Thus, Oude Nektar (originally Jan Lui) was owned by the free slaves Manquard and Jan of Ceylon in 1692.
Jan of Ceylon also owned other properties in Jonkershoek.
Free blacks were people of slave descent or former slaves who had, for a variety of reasons, been freed by their owners.

Spier Wine Estate (R310 Baden Powell Drive) The historic Spier estate is a well-established part of the wine route.
The property was granted to Arnoud Jansz in 1692 although he had lived there since 1683.
Many structures were built on the property, including a slave house.
The former slave quarters now houses a restaurant.
There is a slave bell which was used to signal the start and end of the working day.

Pniel (R310) The evangelisation of slaves and "heathens" in the Groot Drakenstein valley was started by a number of local Christian farmers.
They provided land for religious activities in the area known as "Papieren Molen".
After the emancipation of slaves, the land was extended to accommodate more residents.
This mission station was founded in 1843 to look after the spiritual welfare of freed slaves.
The churchyard had a church, a parsonage and a school.
In Pniel there is an area know as Masbiekvlei or Mozambiquevlei where freed slaves originally from Mozambique lived with their descendents.
A Freedom Monument was erected in Pniel in 1992.

Goede Hoop (R310) A modern slave bell, dated 1934, marks the centenary of the abolition of slavery.
Boschendal (R310) The farm Boschendal, with its imposing buildings forming a formal werf, is a landmark of the wine route.
During the period of slavery, a long building divided into individual rooms, adjacent to the stables and kraals, was constructed to house slaves.
It is still there today.
Tel: 021 870 4200
FRANSCHHOEK
Estate inventories of this area show that slaves were often the farmers' greatest assets.
They were dependent on slaves for labour.
In 1806 the thriving wine industry in the Franschhoek Valley created a group of prosperous farmers.
Wine and brandy were exported to European countries, and access to British markets after the Second British Occupation of the Cape in 1806, contributed to the economic upswing.
Farms were modernised and farmhouses were redecorated.
The well-known Cape Dutch gable became a symbol of the new prosperity.
Slaves not only worked in the vineyards and orchards, but also as builders, carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers and painters and were responsible for making doors, window frames, shutters, nails, as well as thatching.

PAARL
Gebhart had the slave Joris flogged (139 lashes) for not working to his satisfaction.
Joris was found dead the next day.
After a protracted court case Gebhart was found guilty and sentenced to death.
He was hanged on 15 November 1822.
His gravestone is in the museum, a building which was once the Gebhart family's home.
His father was the minister at the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church).
An example of slave chains and entries into a transfer register can also be viewed in the museum.

Het Gesticht (Main Road) Mission work started early in the 19th century in Paarl.
Het Gesticht was erected in 1813 by the Friends of the Mission Movement with the aim of providing religious training to slaves and coloured people.
Before this, slaves and coloured people attended church services in the Strooidakkerk (Thatch Roof Church in Main Street) but it soon became too small to serve the community.
The Paarlse Sending Genootskap took over the building as well as the training programme in 1819.
Nuwe Plantasie (Plantasie Street, behind Grand Roche Hotel) Hermanus Bosman was the sieketrooster from 1707 to 1748 in the Drakenstein congregation.
He applied to the Council of Policy for land in 1715 which, on receiving, he called De Nieuwe Plantage.
Here he built a church for his slaves in 1737.
Kleinbosch (R303, Dal Josafat) In the cemetery on this farm slaves called Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and Clara, are buried.
They were freed slaves who settled with the Du Toit family.
Klaas worked on the farm and his wife Clara worked as a respected midwife from 1830 to 1850.
Kleinbosch belonged to DF du Toit, farmer and owner of Kleinbosch, and the father of the Reverend SJ du Toit, the well-known theologian and leader of the first Afrikaanse Taalbeweging.
Ou Ta, (Klaas) Flora, and Clara
WELLINGTON
Wagenmakersvallei Mission Church (Bovlei) Mission work among the slaves and coloured people in Wagenmakersvallei started in 1796 under JJ van Zulk who counted at least "300 heathens" consisting of Khoekhoen and slaves.
He erected a structure (Gesticht) for this purpose which has not survived.
In 1802 Daniel le Roux was appointed as "oefenmeester".
The church was enlarged in 1868 to its current size.
Two holy communion cups that were used by the congregation are housed in the Wellington Museum
"Queen Rebecca"
The 8th Countess of Stamford
House of Martha Solomons (51 Bain Street) She was the daughter of a slave woman known as "Queen Rebecca" who owned a tavern in Cape Town after emancipation.
Martha, who lived in Wellington, met and married Englishman Harry Grey, the black sheep of an aristocratic family.
After the death of his cousin he inherited a title, and so his wife Martha, a slave descendent, became the 8th Countess of Stamford.
Not open to the public.
An interesting story is that of the Weigt slaves of Wagenmakersvallei.
Their owners, Benjamin Weigt and Anna Lategan, were childless.

Overberg
The name means "over the mountains" - the Hottentots-Holland mountains.
The area was explored by VOC traders and explorers and soon land was given out to farmers who settled there.
With an abundance of land available on the frontier no free person wanted to work for someone else.
The rapid expansion of the colony meant that slaves were also brought into the new areas.
Older male slaves were dispersed among frontier regions on loan farms (the areas of extensive farming) where they worked as herdsmen.
Slave auctions were held at Caledon and Swellendam.
From the days of the Khoekhoen herders, this area had been a stock farming region.
Many of the mission stations founded in this area exist today, for example Genadendal, Elim, Herbertsdale, Slangrivier, Suurbraak, Middleton and Teslaarsdal.

Hangklip (R44, False Bay coast) Runaway slaves from Cape Town would hide out on Table Mountain and slaves from Stellenbosch fled to Cape Town, or tried to reach a group of escapees who survived for many years at Cape Hangklip.
In 1709 a slave, Jacob Smith, organised a large-scale desertion from the Stellenbosch district.
Forty-five slaves escaped and got as far as Swellendam where they were recaptured or returned voluntarily to their owners.
A placaat of 1714 proclaimed that any slave who had been at large for three days or more and who resisted capture could be shot on sight by a colonist.
In 1715 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Stellenbosch sought permission to cut the Achilles tendon of runaways.
Hot springs at Caledon Casino, Hotel and Spa (N2) The Khoekhoen called the hot springs "dispore kamma" meaning "warm water".
In 1708 land around the springs was granted to Ferdinand Appel on condition that he provided bathing facilities for people.
Slaves worked here and rested, using their own facilties.

Teslaarsdal (R326) Johannes Jacobus Tesselaar was a wealthy landowner in the Overberg.
He left an estate in1797 of five farms, 14 male slaves, four female slaves, 125 horses, 60 head of cattle and 500 sheep.
Tesselaar left the farm Hartebeesrivier to some of his slaves.
Direct descendents still own parts of the farm today and the settlement called Teslaarsdal developed on this farm.
Remnants from that period are still visible, and in the graveyard there are graves from descendents Coert, Gertse, Huizenberg, Bredenkamp, among others.
Genealogical research has been done by the Caledon Museum.

Middleton (N2) The Middleton community was established in 1850 with the presentation of land (glebe land) by the Anglican Church to its members, some of whom were of slave descent.
Genealogical studies were undertaken by the Caledon Museum.
Moravian Church started its first mission station at Baviaanskloof, later known as Genadendal, to work among the Khoekhoen of the region.
After emancipation, slaves settled at the mission station.

Moravian Church, GenadendalElim (R317) This mission was founded in 1838 after the Moravian Missionary Society acquired the farm Vogelstruyskraal near Cape Agulhas in the Caledon district.
The newly-established mission became known as "Elim" after the fountains in the area (Exodus 15:27).
The only Slave Emancipation Monument in South Africa can be seen in Church Street near the church.

Napier (R316) Napier was founded in 1838 after the farm Klipdrift was bought from Pieter de Bruyn.
Feeshuis 150, a building next to the Dutch Reformed Church (part of the churchyard), was a wine cellar but was also used to house slaves.
It was restored for Napier's 150th anniversary festival in 1988.
A key is available at the church office.

Struisbaai (R319) In 1766 the VOC hooker (a single-masted ship) Meermin was returning to the Cape with 140 Madagascan slaves and weapons.
The slaves, who were told to clean the weapons, seized the opportunity to take over the ship.
Without navigation skills the slaves had to make use of the crew.
The crew fooled them by sailing in the direction of Madagascar by day and to the Cape by night until they dropped anchor in Struisbaai.
A few of the slaves went ashore where they were captured by local farmers.
The remaining slaves became suspicious and in the resulting skirmish with the crew, the captain ordered the anchor cables to be cut.
Three sealed bottles containing messages were thrown overboard.
The ship ran aground soon afterwards, and the rest of the slaves were captured.
One of the messages that were thrown overboard is housed in the Cape Archives Repository.

The Drostdy (Swellengrebel Street) This was built between 1746 and 1747 using slave labour.
The old wagon shed on the Drostdy museum grounds was used as slave quarters from 1814 to 1834.
The Old Goal dates from the same period as the Drostdy, and is also presumed to have been built by slaves.
The Drostdy Museum is also in possession of compensation receipts issued to slave owners.

Suurbraak (R324) This quaint village nestles in a valley at the foot of the Langeberg Mountains.
Before Suurbraak was established as a mission station in 1809, it was occupied by the indigenous Attaqua people who called the settlement "Xairu" - "a place of beauty".
The London Mission Society established a station here in 1809 and the cottages were built by those who accepted Christianity.
The first missionary was a person called Seidenfaden, invited there by Hans Moos, the leader of the local Attequas.
The church was built around 1835.
Slaves settled here after emancipation.
The first church, parsonage, school, old houses and buildings around the village square have been restored and are in use, as is the Anglican church.
All are situated on the main road through the town.

The Garden Route
Slavery was widely practised in the Southern Cape in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
The VOC outposts of which Outeniqualand and Plettenberg Bay formed a part, as well as the farms of settlers, all have a slave history.
Many villages and towns that originated as missions have a fascinating history involving both slaves and freed slaves.
Caledon Square, later Victoria Square (Courtenay Street) Originally known as the market place, Victoria Square is now a Garden of Remembrance.
It was flanked to the north by the Drostdy and to the east by the jail.
Until 1834, this is where salves were auctioned.

Dutch Reformed Church (Courtenay Street) In 1821 the Church Council decided to build a new church, and by 1830 construction was well under way.
The corner stone was laid on 14 April 1832, followed by a celebratory feast for the bricklayers and plasterers who worked on the building.
The bricklayers and assistants were all slaves.
After emancipation in 1834 they continued their work as "apprentices".
It is recorded that all manual labour was carried out by slaves and that European artisans contributed to the building through cabinet-making only.
The slave bricklayers were Alec, Mirjam, Carto, Adonis and Lasson and the other slaves working on the building were Manjean, Moost, Lange Willem, Jan Rondganger, Willem Bruintjies, Ernest Witbooi, Tune Koopman, Willem Cornelis, Jacob Platjie, Frans Abraham, Aijerdien, Vaaltijn April, Jan Modecam, Willem Hunters, Kobes Wildeman, Fontijn, Jasson, Andries Carolus and Kiewiet.
The church was consecrated in 1842.
It is open on weekdays and Sundays during services.

Pacaltsdorp (R102) This is a small mission station a few kilometers south of George founded by the London Missionary Society in 1812.
He built up a congregation of about 300 Khoekhoen, slaves and free labourers.
Dominating the village is the church built in 1825 of stone quarried from the nearby Outeniqua Mountains with the help of Khoekhoen labourers.

Watsondorp (N12, Preto, east of Blanco) The owner of this farm, a Mrs Bergh, made 30 plots available to ex-slaves.
The land was never formally transferred to the slaves or their descendants.
At a later stage a church and school were erected here to serve the community.

Breede River Valley
Founded in 1820, Worcester is the "capital of the Breede River Valley".
This area includes Ceres, Tulbagh, Montagu, Robertson and Ashton, all known for fruit and wine production.
Mission stations in this area provided a haven for freed slaves, labourers and the dispossessed Khoekhoen.

The Drostdy (High Street) This was built in 1823.
The Bokkeveld slave rebels (see Ceres for more information) were put on trial here in 1826.
Their leaders, Galant and Abel, were sentenced to death.
Rhenish Mission Church (46 Adderley Street) The headquarters of the Rhenish Mission Society in South Africa moved from Steinthal, Tulbagh, to Worcester.
A beautiful church and parsonage were built in 1852 to replace the Gesticht of the Dutch Reformed Church that was used since 1832.
Rhenish School (corner of Adderley and High streets) Missionary Ter Linden started the first school for slave children here on 18 January 1834.
Today this site is part of a cafÉ.
Slave house (R60, next to Kleinplasie Agricultural Museum) This land, originally part of the Roodewal farm, now belongs to the Agricultural Society.
Today the slave house is a bar next to the old farmstead.
Houdenbek Homestead
CERES
Houdenbek A slave uprising took place on the farm Houdenbek in the Koue Bokkeveld, Ceres district, in 1825.
The uprising was led by Galant of the Cape, a slave of WN van der Merwe, and Khoekhoen labourers who killed four people, destroyed crops and then fled.
They were caught, found guilty of high treason, murder and armed robbery, and were sentenced and executed in 1826.
TULBAGH
Also known as Land van Waveren, or Roodezand.
As in many other towns, slaves played an important role in the history of Tulbagh.
Slaves built the second parsonage for the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Land van Waveren in 1765.
The farmers Jan Theron, Pieter Theron, Isaac van der Merwe and Schalk van der Merwe were compensated for sheep, flour, wine, peas and beans supplied to the slaves working on the building.
Jacobus Theron's slaves worked as reed and stone cutters, and the slaves of Jacobus du Toit supplied firewood for use in brick-making.
Slaves also built a wine cellar (1783) and a mill (1790) for the minister.
The minister had many problems with the locals using the mill, and so the church council decided that people who wanted to grind their corn had to supply a slave to do the work, and pay eight stuiwers to the church.
Reverend Michiel Christiaan Vos gave his inaugural sermon to the Roodezand congregation on 4 May 1794, and caused great concern when he announced his intention to extend his evangelical work to workers and slaves.
The congregation's reaction was that "they could already not do much with their slaves and what would happen if they receive an education".
26 Church Street and Oefeningshuis The house was built in 1796 and in 1809 sold to the missionary Cornelis Kramer.
The need arose in the Roodezand Sendinggenootskap to appoint a full-time teacher for the work among the slaves and Khoekhoen.
With the emancipation of the slaves the number of learners rose dramatically, and this influenced the work of the Mission Society.
Gustav Adolph Zahn was the first Rhenish missionary in Tulbagh to assist Vos in his teaching duties.
They also raised funds for a mission church, which was inaugurated on 2 April 1845.
It can be seen in Van der Stel Street but is not open to the public.

40 Church Street This house belonged to Machtelt Smit, the granddaughter of a German mercenary and a freed slave woman.
The Roodezand Mission Society was established here in October 1799.
Today it is a pub and is open to the public.
Steinthal (R44, R46, 5 km outside Tulbagh) In 1843 Zahn bought land on the east side of Tulbagh to serve as an additional haven for freed slaves where they could build a house and have vegetable gardens.
A small school building was erected for the smaller children.
This settlement was called Steinthal and was taken over by the Rhenish Mission Society.
Because of the high standard of education offered here, white children also attended classes.
The table below gives a breakdown of the pupils in 1855.
Today it is part of the Steinthal Children's Home.
The school building is a heritage site and serves as a useful library and resources centre.
It is presumed that the cemetery has slave graves.

Little Karoo
This area is the fertile valley enclosed by the Swartberg, Langeberg and the Outeniqua mountains.
The area was explored by European settlers from the late 17th century, who encountered Khoisan people living here.
The semi-arid area was turned into a productive farming district.
This area boasts the most spectacular rock formations and passes.
Well-known mission stations situated here are Zoar, Amalienstein and Dysselsdorp.
Click here for a map of the Little Karoo.
ZOAR AND AMALIENSTEIN
Zoar and Amalienstein (Not far from the Hoeko turnoff, about 21 km from Ladismith) The Zoar settlement was established in 1817 by Petrus Johannes Joubert, a missionary of the South African Missionary Society.
He named the mission station after the biblical name "Zoar".
When Joubert left in 1833 the South African Missionary Society found it difficult to replace him, and called in the help of the Berlin Mission Society which bought the adjacent land and set up its own station and named it "Amalienstein", after its benefactress, Frau Amalie von Stein.
Here a church (1853), school and houses were erected.
Zoar was run by Reinhold Gregorowski of the Berlin Mission Society from 1837.
In 1838 Zoar had a church and huts forming a village which was inhabited by 300 to 400 Khoekhoen people.
The inhabitants were taught farming methods and religious instruction and received an education.
After emancipation, slaves settled at the mission stations.

In October 1808, 326 slaves from over 30 farms in this region rebelled and marched on Cape Town to demand their freedom.
They were led by Louis of Mauritius, Abraham of the Cape and an Irishman James Hooper, who promised them their freedom.
They concentrated on the slaves of Pieter Louw of the Swartland and spread the uprising towards Koeberg and Tygervalley.
In total 34 farms were plundered, the farmers bound and taken prisoner.
When the slaves began to march to Cape Town, the Govenor, the Earl of Caledon, dispatched soldiers to the troubled area and all 326 slaves were taken prisoner.
Five of the ringleaders were hanged publicly and their corpses were displayed in order to deter anyone of like mind.
Large numbers of slaves worked in the labour-intensive wheat farms and mixed farming areas found in the Swartland and West Coast.
Many mission stations in this area also testify to the missionary work done among the Khoekhoen and the slaves.
The well-known ones are Wupperthal and Mamre, but there is also Papendorp, Troe-Troe Mission station in Van Rhynsdorp and Ebenhaezer.

The missionaries Kohrhammer and Schmidt set out to work among the local Khoekhoen but the mission station also served as a haven for freed slaves.
Today the old kerkwerf (churchyard) can still be seen as well as a mill, bakery, stables and a school.

Goedverwacht, Burgershoek near Piketberg (off the R399 between Piketberg and Velddrif) This settlement was the lawful property of a group of former slaves, who inherited the farm Burgerskloof from the owner, Hendrik Schalk Burger, upon emancipation in 1838.
He left the farm to his slave Maniesa and her five children on condition that they take care of him until his death.
His own children later contested the will, but the court upheld it and the farm remained Maniesa's property up to the death of her last child Hester in 1888.
Her grave can be seen in the graveyard.
Goedverwacht, a Moravian mission station, was established here later when the slave descendants sold the land to the Moravian missionaries for £750.

Wupperthal (R364, 74 km from Clanwilliam) In 1828 two Rhenish missionaries, Johann Gottlieb Leipoldt and J von Wurm jointly bought the farm Rietmond on the Tratra River in the Cedarberg District.
A mission station was established and named Wupperthal after the missionaries' home town in Germany.
A large number of freed slaves settled here after emancipation.
The Rhenish Missionary Society started several industries, namely, masonry, millinery, leather tanning, woodwork, thatching and shoe-making, an industry that is still practised.
Today it is a Moravian mission station.

Students who need to fund their own studies have limited options, such as private loans from banks, part-time employment, assistance from family members and, for the lucky few, bursaries.
For those who are academically deserving and financially needy, there is another option: NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme) offers a unique opportunity to access a loan, part of which can be converted to a bursary.
The scheme also runs a number of loan or bursary schemes on behalf of other organisations and bodies, such as the Department of Labour.
Get more information about these options from the Financial Aid Bureau at the university or technikon where you intend studying or where you have registered.
What is NSFAS?
The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is a loan and bursary scheme operating in terms of Act 56 of 1999 and funded by the National Department of Education.
Where does TEFSA fit it?
TEFSA, established in 1991, managed and administered the National Student Financial Aid Scheme since its inception in 1996.
Act 56 of 1999 converted TEFSA into a statutory body called NSFAS in July 2000.
CONTENTS: Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS
Home > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt How, What, When, Where...
How, What, When, Where...
What does NSFAS Offer?
* The means to obtain a tertiary education.
* Loans at low interest rates.
* Loans without guarantees.
* A reasonable repayment plan.
What is a Loan?
* A loan is money you borrow to cover tertiary studies.
* This Loan has to be repaid.
What is a Bursary?
* A bursary is that portion of the award that does not need to be repaid.
* The size of the bursary is dependent on your academic success.
Who Qualifies for a NSFAS Loan?
To qualify for a loan you must be:
* registered at a South African university or technikon
* an undergraduate, studying for a first tertiary educational qualification, or
* studying for a second tertiary qualification, if this is necessary to practise in your chosen profession (eg LLB or HDE)
* able to demonstrate potential for academic success
* financially needy.
How Much Money do you Get?
The maximum award in 2004 was R25,000 and the minimum was R2,000.
What is the Role of the University an Technikon's Financial Aid Bureaux?
* Offer advice about loans.
* Assist with loan applications.
* Explain how you access the money and how you have to repay the money.
* Evaluate your ability to succeed in your chosen course.
* Conduct a means test that will determine whether you are really among the financially needy.
Where do you Apply for a Loan?
From Financial Aid Bureaux at the university or technikon where you are/or plan on studying.
How is the Bursary Component of your Loan Calculated?
Up to 40% of the award may be converted into a bursary, dependent on your end of year results.
* If you pass all the courses for which you have registered, you qualify for a 40% bursary.
* If you pass three quarters of the courses, you qualify for a 30% bursary.
* If you pass half of the courses, you qualify for a 20% bursary.
* If you pass one quarter of the courses, you qualify for a 10% bursary.
* If you pass none of the courses, you qualify for no bursary at all.
What Happens if You Have Money Left Over in Your Account?
* You can't receive more money from NSFAS than you require.
* If there is money left over in your fee account at the end of the year (for example, if you received a bursary or a merit award after the NSFAS award was granted), the Financial Aid Bureau has to return the money to NSFAS.
This will count as your first loan repayment.
* Money left over in your account is never paid out to you.
Furthermore, it is in your interest to ensure that the money is returned to NSFAS to avoid paying interest on it.
What about Interest?
Interest on NSFAS awards will be calculated at 7% for 2004 as of 1 April 2004.
What Is Interest and Why does NSFAS Charge It?
Interest is the cost of borrowing money.
Money, like any other commodity, has a price attached to it.
If you deposit money into a bank account, you earn interest - in other words, the bank pays you because it can make use of your money while it is deposited with them.
When you take back your money, you stop earning interest.
If you borrow money from the bank, you have to pay the bank for the use of their money.
In previous years commercial banks have charged as much as 23% interest on student loans.
If you had received one of these loans you would be required to pay back the loan within a specific period whether you are employed or not.
By comparison, NSFAS's interest rate is equal to the rate of inflation (typically in the late 1990s 9%) plus 2%.
This 2% helps sustain the loan scheme.
It contributes towards the administration costs and the shortfall resulting from death and long-term non-repayment due to unemployment.
What is Inflation?
* Each year money loses value and can buy less.
* The decline in the value of money from one year to the next is called inflation.
* An example of how inflation affects your studies is the increase in fees each year.
* In order for NSFAS to be able to assist students in future, NSFAS has to try to make sure that the value of its money is retained.
That is why its interest rate is tied to the inflation rate.
* NSFAS's interest rate is low because it is subsidised by donations from government, private sector companies and overseas donors.
Home > Publications > Public Information > S > Student Guide to Funding - NSFAS &gt Paying Back the Loan
Paying Back the Loan
When Do You Start to Pay Back?
Once you are employed and your annual salary is R26,300 or more.
How Much Do You Pay Back?
* The repayments are worked out at a rate that will not place a great burden on you.
* Therefore, repayments are based on the salary that you earn.
* And repayments only start once your salary is R26,300 or more per year (ie R2,192 per month).
At this level your repayment is 3% of your annual salary.
The rate at which you repay your loan is reflected in the Ready Reckoner Table.
How Do You Pay Back?
* NSFAS sends quarterly statements to all students and will later send a letter information you of your settlement terms once you become eligible to pay back your loan.
This happens once you start earning over R26 300 a year.
* You are then expected to make the necessary arrangements.
These can include a debit order on your bank account, direct deposits into the NSFAS account, postal orders, cheques or employer deductions.
* While NSFAS will inform you how much you need to pay, it is your responsibility to ensure that you keep in touch with

Grants, Benefits And Compensation: An Overview
There are a number of forms of financial relief available to different people in different circumstances, including:
* The Unemployment Insurance Fund
* The Occupational Injuries and Diseases Compensation Fund
* The Road Accidents Fund
Who can claim from which fund?
Grants
There are a number of grants for poor people provided by the South African Social Security Agency.
All grants are for poor people only (a "means test" applies).
Unemployment Insurance
If you have been employed, you can get unemployment insurance benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) run by the National Department of Labour.
Compensation
If you are temporarily or permanently disabled because of an accident at work, you can get compensation from the Compensation Fund at the National Department of Labour.
If you are injured in a motor vehicle accident, you can get compensation from the Road Accident Fund for your medical expenses, disablement, and loss of income.
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Social Security Grants
Social Security Grants
The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has three types of grant for looking after children:
* Child Support Grant
* Care Dependency Grant
* Foster Child Grant.
You can get a child support grant for each child under 14, if you are the child's primary care-giver.
You can get a care dependency grant for each child under 18 who needs full-time care because of a physical or mental disability, if you are the child's parent or guardian.
Both of these grants depend on how poor you are.
You can get a foster child grant if you have been legally appointed a foster parent by a court.
Whether you get this grant depends on how poor the child is, NOT on how poor you are.
However, you CAN get a foster child grant and a care dependency grant, if you qualify for both.
For adults, SASSA has the following kinds of grants:
* Old age grant
* Disability grant
* War veteran's grant.
The old age grant is for women over 60 and men over 65.
The disability grant is for adults over 18 who are not able to work because of their disability.
If you were disabled because of an accident at work, you may be able to get compensation from the Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund.
If you were disabled because of a motor vehicle accident, you may be able to get compensation from the Road Accident Fund.
The war veterans grant is for adults over 60 or anyone who is unable to work because of a disability, and who served in the 1st or 2nd World War or the Korean War.
The provincial Department of Social Development can also provide temporary help in crisis situations with a financial award called "social relief of distress".
This is for people who cannot provide for their families' basic needs because of a crisis of a temporary nature.
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Benefits
Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Benefits
If you have been employed before, then you can collect Unemployment Insurance from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) if you have been unemployed for more than 14 days.
If you have never had a job you cannot claim from the UIF.
Everyone who works for more than 24 hours per month is supposed to be registered with the UIF and to make a contribution of 1% of their earnings (along with contributions from their employer) to the UIF.
If you have been contributing, you can claim benefits if you become unemployed (if you are fired or retrenched, but not if you quit).
You must claim your UIF benefit within 6 months of becoming unemployed.
How much you can claim and for how long you can claim depend on how long you were working and how much you were earning.
You can get one day's benefit for every 6 days you worked, up to a maximum of 238 days (which you reach after working for 4 years).
You cannot claim any benefit for any amount of time that you worked and at the same time received a Social Services grant for yourself.
If you earned more than R8099 per month before, you will get a flat benefit of R101,18 per day.
For example, if you earned R1000 per month before, you will get R17,34 per day.
UIF can also be claimed by the partner or dependants of a worker who has died.
You can also get a UIF benefit if you can't work because of ill-health (for up to 6 months, but takes into account any sick leave).
You can get a maternity benefit when you have a child, or an adoption benefit if you adopt a child younger than two years and have to take off work to look after the child.
Only one parent can get maternity or adoption benefits.
You must apply for the maternity benefit at least eight weeks before the birth of the child.
You must apply for the adoption benefit within 6 months of the adoption order.
You can apply for UIF benefits at any Labour Centre
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)
Occupational Injuries Compensation Fund (formerly Workers' Compensation)
The accident must be identified by its date, time and place and must have happened as a direct result of your employment.
For temporary total disablement, you can get compensation equal to 75% of your monthly earnings, up to a maximum of R2 868,00 per week.
For permanent disablement, where the degree of disablement is 30% or less, you can get a lump sum (one payment) which is usually equal to 15 times your monthly earnings.
However, the minimum lump sum is 15 times R1359,00 = R20 385,00 (if you earn less than R1359 you will get R20 385).
The maximum lump sum 15 times R6 963,00 = R104 445,00 (if you earn more than R6963,00 you will get R104 445,00).
If the degree of permanent disablement is 31% or more, you will not get a lump sum, you will get a monthly pension instead.
The pension for total permanent disablement (degree of disablement 100%) is equal to 75% of your monthly earnings.
If the degree of disablement is less than 100%, the pension is proportionately less.
If the employee's earnings are R1 359,00 per month or less, the pension is calculated on R1 359,00.
The minimum pension in respect of 100% permanent disablement is therefore R1 019,25 per month.
Where an employee dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to
* a lump sum equal to two times the monthly pension to which the employee would have been entitled to if 100% disabled
* a pension equivalent to 40% of the pension to which the employee would have been entitled, if 100% disabled.
Where the employee dies, each child under 18 years of age is entitled to a monthly pension equal to 20% of the pension which would have been payable to the employee for 100% disablement, up to a maximum of three children.
The maximum pension payable to the spouse and children together is therefore R9 321,00 per month.
All reasonable medical and transport costs arising from the accident are also paid for by the Compensation Fund.
You can apply for compensation from the Compensation Fund at any of these labour centres.
How does this compensation affect a Social Security grant?
Home > Publications > Public Information > T > Government Financial Assistance &gt Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)
Road Accident Fund (formerly Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund)
The Road Accident Fund (RAF) was set up to pay compensation in respect of people injured or killed in road accidents through the negligent driving of a motor vehicle in South Africa.
The system was changed so that instead of compulsory insurance, there is now a fund, which gets its money from a levy on the sale of fuel.
People can make a claim for compensation against the RAF if they are injured in a motor vehicle accident as a result of negligent driving.
You must make your application to the RAF within 2 years of the date of the accident in which you sustained your injuries.
You can make the claim yourself by completing Form 1 and submitting all the necessary documents; or you can get an attorney to help with your claim.
The exact amount ("quantum") paid out for a claim against the RAF depends on your medical expenses, your loss of income (past and future), your disablement, and your pain and suffering.

How will compensation from the RAF affect a Social Security grant?
If, taking into account any compensation you get from the Road Accident Fund, your income is still below the means test set by SASSA, you may qualify for one of the Social Security grants.
In other words, if your income (including the compensation from the RAF) is less than R1410 per month, you may qualify also for the disability grant.

If you are a parent, make sure you contribute a fair amount towards upbringing of your children, whether you live with them or not.
If you are a relative of someone who cannot afford to contribute, such as grandparents, try your best to help the children: after all, they still need support.
You can also help the children by persuading parents who are not paying or who are not paying enough, to pay a fair amount of maintenance: their children need it.

Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Why Pay Maintenance?
Why Pay Maintenance?
If you do not live with your children, you are not there day to day to provide their basic needs such as shelter, food, clothing, medical care and schooling.
So, you must pay money as maintenance to help the parent living with the children to provide the children with these basic needs.
If you do not pay maintenance, your children:
1. may not have enough food;
2. may not be able to see a doctor if they are sick;
3. if school fees cannot be paid, may not be able to go to school.
Maintenance ensures that your children keep, as much as possible, the same standard of living as before the parents separated.
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt How Is Maintenance Paid?
How Is Maintenance Paid?
Most parents decide themselves how the parent living away from the children should support his or her children and contribute his or her share towards their upbringing.
However, the maintenance system is there if the parents cannot decide themselves how maintenance should be paid, or how much.
The parent living with the children can go to a maintenance court in order to obtain maintenance from the other parent.
The maintenance court can order the parent living away from the children to pay maintenance to the other parent, for the benefit of the children.
The maintenance court will tell the parent how much is to be paid, when it is to be paid, and where it should be paid.
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt Must I Still Pay Maintenance if...?
Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What If the Parents have other Children?
What If the Parents have other Children?
A parent's duty to maintain his or her children continues even if the parent living with the children has other children.
f the parent, living away from the children, is concerned about the welfare of the children, he or she is still required to pay maintenance, though he or she could make a complaint to the welfare authorities or apply to a court to have the children come and live with him or her.
If the parent living away from the children has other children himself or herself, he or she is still obliged to pay maintenance.
He or she must still pay maintenance if her or she now lives with a new partner and that partner's children.
However, there might be a change in how much maintenance a parent must pay if he or she has further children of his or her own.

Home > Publications > Public Information > Y > You and Maintenance: Maintenance is in the Best Interests of the Child &gt What Happens if Maintenance Is not Paid?
What Happens if Maintenance Is not Paid?
If maintenance is not paid, children suffer, and they:
* may not have enough food;
* may not be able to see a doctor if they are sick;
* if school fees cannot be paid, may not be able to go to school.
Sometimes the parent living with the children may have to go out to work to get money and may not always be able to provide child care or supervision for the children.

The decision to settle is in the hands of the parties involved.
At a conciliation meeting the employer may appear in person or may be represented by a director or another employee or an employers' organisation.
The employee may be represented by an office-bearer or official of the employee's registered trade union.
If the applicant fails to attend the conciliation hearing at the scheduled time, the matter will be dismissed.
Should the applicant wish to continue, an application for rescission of the dismissal must be made.

﻿Application to register a copyright
"Protect" means preventing others from copying or reproducing such work or material and using it to further their own financial gain.
The Copyright Act, 1978 dictates copyright.
If you have an original idea, you cannot have copyright to it.
You must first put your original idea into a physical form, such as into a book, a card, a CD, a painting, a picture, a screenplay or a film.
Generally a person who has written, printed, published, performed, sculpted, painted, filmed or recorded a work, is automatically the owner of the copyright to that work.
However sometimes, when a person has been commissioned and paid to do a particular piece of work, the copyright belongs to the employer.
For most works it is not necessary to apply for copyright.
Copyright is created by putting the words "copyright" or "copyright reserved" or "copyright Smith 2002", or the copyright symbol, name and year.
You can obtain copyright in South Africa if you are South African citizen or if your work was produced in South Africa.
If you are not South African citizen, you can obtain a copyright provided the other country is part of the Berne Convention.
The Berne Convention is an international agreement on copyright by which member countries grant each other copyright protection.
Having a copyright provides "ownership" of such material and control of its commercial use.

Additional requirements for registration in the field of practice
The great variety of qualifications in the field of environmental science, offered by universities in particular, makes it at times almost impossible to evaluate a single qualification in this multi-disciplinary science.
It is therefore necessary to first establish whether a person would qualify as a scientist in one of the generic fields of practice.
Individuals who wish to practice as environmental scientists are required to register with the South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions.
The qualification must:
include at least one subject, other than environmental science, from the fields of practice listed in Schedule I of the Natural Sciences Professions Act, 2003
be based on at least two of the appropriate level-I basic natural science subjects of physics, chemistry, mathematics and/or biology.
In addition to the above a person wishing to be registered in the field of Environmental Science should be able to provide proof of training in Environmental Management.
These can either be part of the four-year degree programme or by way of accredited short courses.
You should have a clear record of environmental science related work and research.
Such Environmental Facilitators should have persons with natural science training in their teams.
Applicants will have to provide proof of their personal involvement in at least two or more projects.
Projects completed will be considered, provided that a clear substantiated indication is provided of personal contribution.
Registration by the Environmental Assessment Practitioners of South Africa will be deemed as sufficient proof of the above.
In addition, information must be provided of conferences attended, scientific papers and publications.
The council will register and issue a registration certificate if it is satisfied that you have the relevant educational requirements and experience as determined by the council.

The completed case docket is allocated to a police detective who will carry out the investigation.
All enquiries can be directed to this detective.
The detective in charge of the particular case will complete the investigation and present the docket to the relevant court for prosecution.
The detective will notify the complainant when he or she must attend the court hearings.
The police officer taking your statement will fill in a form.

The estate of a deceased person must be reported to the Master within 14 days of the date of death.
The death can be reported by any person who has control or possession of any property belonging to the estate of the deceased, or who has control or possession of a document by the deceased that is or purports to be a will.
When must a death be reported to the Master?
if the deceased died in South Africa and left property and/or any document that is a will or is intended as a will
if the deceased died outside South Africa, but left in South Africa property and/or any document that is a will or is intended as a will.
Where must a deceased estate be reported?
Although all magistrates' offices are service points for the Master where estates of the deceased can be reported, they have limited jurisdiction and shall transfer all estates with wills, as well as estates that exceed R50 000 in value, to the provincial office of the Master.
If you wish to report such an estate, it is therefore best to do so to directly at the Master's office.
If the value of the estate is less than R50 000, report the estate to the magistrate's office.
If the value exceeds R50 000, report it directly to the Master's office.
If the deceased was living in South Africa at the time of his or her death, report the estate to the Master who has jurisdiction of the area where the deceased was living at the time of his or her death.
If the deceased was not living in South Africa at the time of his or her death, you can report the estate to any Master.
Report the estate by completing Form J294: Death Notice: Death notice and the other relevant reporting documents listed below.
You can obtain the Death notice and other reporting documents from any office of the Master of the high court or from any magistrate's office.
The value of the estate and the type of appointment required will determine which documents you have to complete and submit.
If the value of the estate is under R125 000, complete the following documents:
Form J294: Death Notice
Form J192: Affidavit particulars of next of kin next of kin – to be completed if the deceased did not leave a valid will
Form J243: Inventory
Nomination to act as executor – to be completed by the heirs to appointment a Master's representative:
if it is an intestate estate or
if the will does not nominate a specific executor or
if the nominated executor has died or has declined the appointment
Form J155: Undertaking and acceptance of Master's directions.
Append the following documents to the completed forms listed above:
the original death certificate or a certified copy thereof
an original marriage certificate or a certified copy thereof – if applicable
a list of creditors of deceased – if applicable
a declaration confirming that the estate has not already been reported to another Master's office or another service point of the Master.
If the value of the estate is under R125 000, the Master may dispense with letters of executorship, and instead issue letters of authority in terms of Section 18 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1965.
If the value of the estate exceeds R125 000, complete the following documents:
Form J192: Affidavit: particulars of next of kin – to be completed if the deceased did not leave a valid will.
This affidavit, by the next of kin of a deceased black person who did not leave a valid will, must state that the estate has not been reported to another Master or another service point.
Nomination to act as executor/Nomination form – to be completed by the heirs to appointment a Master's representative:
if the nominated executor has died or has declined the appointment.
Form J190: Acceptance of trust as Executor – to be completed in duplicate by the person nominated as executor
Form J262: Undertaking and Bond of Security – to be completed unless the nominated executor:
is the parent, spouse or child of the deceased.
Submit the completed forms listed above together with the following documents:
an original marriage certificate or a certified copy thereof – if applicable)
all original wills and codicils or documents intended as such – if any.
If the value of the estate exceeds R125 000, letters of executorship must be issued, and the full process prescribed by the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, must be followed.
The service points only have jurisdiction if the deceased did not leave a valid will and the gross value of the deceased estate is under R50 000.
A letter of authority entitles the nominated representative to administer the estate without following the full procedure prescribed in the Administration of Estates Act, 1965.

Return for payment of provisional tax – third payment
The provisional tax paid will be offset against the final income tax that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assessment.
The'effective' date is
in the case of the year of assessment ending on 28 or 29 February, seven months thereafter
for approved financial year-ends that end on a date other than 28 or 29 February, six months thereafter.
The third payment is a voluntary payment that any provisional taxpayer may make.
Taxpayers with a taxable income of more than R50 000 or companies with a taxable income of R20 000 or more, may make a third voluntary payment to avoid interest being levied on any underpayment of tax on assessment.
The purpose of this payment is to enable taxpayers to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year, and the total tax liability for the year of assessment.
The third period represents the total tax payable for the full year, less:
the employees tax paid for the full year
any allowable foreign tax credits for the full year
the amounts paid for the first and second provisional tax periods.
It is up to each provisional taxpayer to identify when a top-up third payment is necessary.
Obtain the new payment advice from SARS or download it from this site, complete it and submit it together with payment.
Because the payment advice is generic and does not carry detail relating to a specific taxpayer, it is of the utmost importance that provisional taxpayers enter the correct account details on this advice.
If the correct details are not entered, the payment cannot be credited to the correct taxpayer.
The account details are made up as follows:
The tax reference number of the taxpayer
P0003 – indicating the payment period
2005 – indicating the year of assessment.
A typical payment reference number will thus be 1234567123P00032005.
Provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidays.
Where payments are made by mail, via the bank or ATM, sufficient time for mailing or processing must be taken into account.
Where payments are done electronically, provision must be made for your bank's cut-off times and for a clearance period that could take between two and five days.
the client's 19-digit payment reference number
The third period payment should be based on actual taxable income, as the purpose of this payment is to enable you to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year and the full tax liability for that tax year.

Advice to South African citizens in the event a South African is arrested or jailed abroad
Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which is the accepted standard for all member countries, persons who have been arrested outside their own country must have access to their consular representative.
South Africans in this situation must immediately request the authorities to allow them to contact the South African Representative in that country.
Alternatively, somebody can contact the South African Representative in that country or the Chief Directorate: Consular Services of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Pretoria on your behalf.
Consular Officers seek to ensure that South African citizens arrested abroad are treated humanely while incarcerated.
Issues such as torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment will be reported and taken up with the local authorities.
The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners is used as a guide.
Establish contact with the detainee as soon as possible after verifying South African citizenship..
Provide general information about the legal system of the country of arrest.
Information may include details on legal aid and prosecution, a list of lawyers remand, bail and appeal procedures so that he/she understands his/her rights and the processes involved.
Undertake prison visits.
The frequency of prison visits depends on current policy, the location, culture and laws of the arresting State, the prevailing security situation in the country and/or the prison and subject to the Mission's operational circumstances.
Ensure that medical problems are brought to the attention of the prison authorities.
However, the operational priorities of the Embassy/High Commission/ Consulate take precedence.
Local circumstances in the country also play a role.
What Consular Officers cannot do for South Africans detained/arrested abroad:
obtain or give legal advice
organise a release from prison or bail
travel to dangerous areas or prisons for a prison visit
investigate a crime
obtain better treatment in prison than that provided for local nationals, unless the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are not applied
instruct next-of-kin or friends to transfer money
pay legal, medical or any other bills
obtain accommodation, work, visas or residence permits
undertake work done by travel agents, airlines, banks or car rental companies
formally assist dual nationals in the country of their second nationality
in the unfortunate event of death, pay for the preparation, transport, burial or cremation of the mortal remains of a South African citizen.
If a dual national is arrested/detained in another country, of which he/she is not a national, and he/she did not travel on a South African passport but on the passport of his/her second nationality, the dual national must contact the consular representative of the country on which passport he/she travelled.
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
Note: No Prisoner Transfer Agreements exist between South Africa and any other country.
The service standard is determined on an individual case basis and depends on circumstances in the country of arrest.
The Department of Foreign Affairs determines the cost where applicable, based on the services provided.
The South African representative will provide the detainee with the relevant application forms.
