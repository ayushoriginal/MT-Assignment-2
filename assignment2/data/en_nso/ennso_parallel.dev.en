Return for payment of provisional tax – third payment

The account details are made up as follows:
Consult the IRP 12 Guidelines if you require assistance in the completion of your IRP 6 return.
The tax reference number of the taxpayer
the client's 19-digit payment reference number
Provisional tax payments may be made at any SARS branch office, Mondays to Fridays, between 08h00 and 15h30, excluding public holidays.

the employees tax paid for the full year

The third payment is a voluntary payment that any provisional taxpayer may make.
Payments that do not comply with both the above-mentioned payment reference number and the beneficiary ID will not be accepted.
The provisional tax paid will be offset against the final income tax that the individual has to pay for the relevant year of assessment.
It is up to each provisional taxpayer to identify when a top-up third payment is necessary.
The purpose of this payment is to enable taxpayers to pay the difference between employees tax plus provisional tax already paid for the year, and the total tax liability for the year of assessment.
Because the payment advice is generic and does not carry detail relating to a specific taxpayer, it is of the utmost importance that provisional taxpayers enter the correct account details on this advice.

﻿This situation was reversed only with the advent of democracy in 1994 and the Constitutional provisions on official multlingualism.
which stresses multilingualism as an extension of cultural diversity and an integral part of building a non-racial South Africa.
A persons language is in many ways a second skin: a natural possession of every normal human being,
Principles
The National Language Policy Framework is based on the outcome of our consultation processes,
Section 6 and contain language-related provisions for national and provincial governments, whereby government departments must use at least two of the official languages.
The underlying principle is to retain the learners home language for learning and teaching, but to encourage learners to acquire additional languages as well.
This resulted in language inequality, and the dominance of English and Afrikaans
SECTION 4
Promoting multilingualism in South Africa requires efforts that do not discount the knowledge that exists in societies where indigenous official languages are prominent.
SECTION 2
South African Qualifications Authority
Section 6 of the Constitution requires mechanisms to be put in place to develop these indigenous languages.
This will be facilitated by the use and involvement of communities as participants in the processes of language development.
Approach
All these practices engendered the corollary status of the indigenous languages and language varieties of the African people
To promote linguistic diversity further, section 6 provides for the establishment of the Pan South African Language Board to promote multilingualism
It is through language that we function as human beings in an ever-changing world.
The right to use the official languages of our choice has therefore been recognised in our Bill of Rights,
It is in this spirit that the promotion of all 11 official languages of our country, as provided for in the Constitution, takes centre stage in the policy.
This policy framework must therefore cater adequately for the harmonisation of language policy
and subsequently the establishment of the Republic of South Africa and the apartheid regime, government language policy and the power elite failed to recognise South Africas linguistic diversity.
Recognising that languages are resources to maximise knowledge, expertise and full participation in the political and socioeconomic domains;
Section 9 protects against unfair discrimination on the grounds of language,

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
When a language loses its value in these spheres the status of the language diminishes.
of which 11 have been granted official status in terms of section 6 of the Constitution,
at all three levels of government and articulate clear policy positions on the status and use of the indigenous official languages in all nine provinces in South Africa.
Section 6 of the Constitution provides the principal legal framework for multilingualism, the development of the official languages and the promotion of respect and tolerance for South Africas linguistic diversity.
This Policy Framework also takes into account that we are faced with the challenge of globalisation and that our indigenous languages should be part of the rapidly expanding technological environment.
and political recognition to hitherto disadvantaged language groups on the basis of the expressed needs of communities and interest groups.
Scope
The approach recognises the following:
while sections 30 and 31 refer to peoples rights in terms of cultural, religious and linguistic participation and enjoyment.
The Constitution mandates change to the language situation throughout the country, giving social

ensure redress for the previously marginalised official indigenous languages;
After eight years of democracy, South Africa has now arrived at a crucial point in its history.
Final Draft November 2002
The 11 official languages are isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu and siSwati; Sesotho, Sepedi and Setswana; Tshivenda, Xitsonga, English and Afrikaans.
A striking characteristic of multilingualism in South Africa is the fact that several indigenous languages are spoken across provincial borders; shared by speech communities from different provinces.
promote the equitable use of the 11 official languages;
on the grounds that their usage includes about 98 of the total population.
The Constitution and related legislation clearly advocate the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa.
The language policy is based on the following principles:
Historical context
Since the first occupation of South Africa by the Dutch in 1652, through successive periods of British rule, the Union of South Africa,
There is currently a strong awareness of the need to intensify efforts to develop the previously marginalised indigenous languages and to promote multilingualism
It takes into account the broad acceptance of linguistic diversity, social justice, the principle of equal access to public services and programmes, and respect for language rights.
South Africa is therefore a multilingual country.

measures to regulate and monitor the use of disadvantaged indigenous languages.
I am particularly proud that, after a thorough process of consultation, we are finally in a position to announce a framework for a language policy for South Africa.
To date management of linguistic diversity in post-apartheid South Africa has been made problematic by the lack of a clearly defined language policy,
The Policy Framework not only initiates a fresh approach to multilingualism in South Africa, but strongly encourages the utilisation of the indigenous languages as official languages in order to foster and promote national unity.

This Policy Framework also takes cognisance of the fact that the value of our languages is largely determined by their economic, social and political usage.

The Constitution emphasises that all official languages must enjoy parity of

It determines the language rights of citizens, which must be honoured through national language policies.
and our Constitution acknowledges that the languages of our people are a resource that should be harnessed.
The policy framework is fundamental to the management of our diverse language resources and the achievement of governments goal to promote democracy, justice, equity and national unity.
This document sets out an enabling framework for a coherent multilingual dispensation within the parameters of the Constitution.

The Department of Education introduced a Language in Education Policy,
Preventing the use of any language for the purposes of exploitation, domination and discrimination;
affirming and making us proud of our unique South African identity.
enforcing negative stereotypes of the African languages, which are held not only by English and Afrikaans speakers, but even by many of the speakers of the African languages themselves.
The language policy takes cognisance of the constitutional provisions on multilingualism and is in concert with governments goals for economic, socio-political and educational growth.
Hence, it intends to reaffirm the status and use of the indigenous languages of South Africa.
and promote good language management for efficient public service administration to meet client expectations and needs.

SECTION 1
South African Sign Language
This step was essential in view of the lack of tolerance for linguistic diversity and the resultant multilingualism is a costly problem approach evident in some sectors of our society,
I sincerely trust that all South Africans will embrace this National Language Policy Framework as their own.
I believe that collectively we have to ensure that the policy becomes a reality in our lives,
BUILDING HUMAN CAPACITY
Telephone Interpreting Service for South Africa
This is the finalisation of a process that started in 1995, when I appointed the Language Plan Task Group to advise me on a framework for a coherent language policy and plan.
LiEP deals with such matters as language of learning and teaching in public schools, school curricula,
and the growing criticism from language stakeholders of the tendency towards unilingualism in South Africa.
Pan South African Language Board
if South Africans are to be liberated from undue reliance on the utilisation of non-indigenous languages as the dominant, official languages of the state.
therefore gave rise to a hierarchy of languages, the inequality of which that reflected the structures of racial and class inequality that characterised South African society.
To promote multilingualism this policy determines the use of different languages in government structures as follows:
SECTION 3: BUILDING HUMAN CAPACITY
Government publications: A publication programme of functional multilingualism should be followed by national government departments in those cases that do not require publication in all 11 official languages.
Where the effective and stable operation of government at any level requires comprehensive communication of information
If necessary, every effort must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as interpreting where practically possible.
The infrastructure required to operationalise the policy will be put in place.
taking into account their regional circumstances, and the needs and preferences of communities, as stated in the Constitution.
It will be expedient to engage language specialists to assist the process of developing functional multilingual programmes through research and the dissemination of findings.
, it must be published in all 11 official languages and, in the provinces, in all the official languages prescribed in the Province.
The scope or provisions of the policy are as follows:
Other implementation mechanisms that will be operationalised are a Language Code of Conduct for Public Servants, the establishment of the SA Language Practitioners Council,
In collaboration with PanSALB, the Department of Arts and Culture will monitor progress and report at specified intervals to all relevant authorities.
written communication with the public; and international communication where applicable.
A principle of rotation must be applied when selecting languages for publishing government documents in the Nguni and Sotho groups.
This will include the establishment of language units in all national departments and in the provinces to manage ―

Capacity building in the identified areas of language facilitation will take place in close collaboration with service providers such as tertiary institutions offering SAQA-accredited programmes
The selection of languages will be made as follows:
Afrikaans.
All oral communication must take place in the preferred official language of the target audience.
Government structures will have time to plan their budgets by gradually increasing allocations
The areas of terminography and terminology will likewise be affected.
Tshivenda;
The advantage of the gradual phasing in methodology is that departments will be able to develop capacity incrementally and manage the implementation process more effectively.
In promoting multilingualism provinces will formulate their policies in line with the guidelines contained in this Policy Framework,
over the MTEF period and planning operations in line with the resources required for successful policy implementation.
Government will encourage, and where necessary support, private enterprises to develop and implement their own language policies in accordance with the national language policy framework.

The increase in translation work will require accelerated development of terminology in the official languages and of a National Termbank that is accessible to both government and freelance language practitioners.

Upon determination of the language use and preference of communities, local governments must, in broad consultation with their communities, develop, publicise and implement a multilingual policy.
must be made to utilise language facilitation facilities such as translation and/or interpreting where practically possible.
Monitoring mechanisms for assuring the quality of translation and editing services will be developed.
Policy reviews will be conducted regularly and recommendations will be made for amendments where necessary so that budgets can be adjusted accordingly.
Provided that where practically possible no person will be prevented from using the language of his or her preference.
All government structures, as well as institutions exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of legislation are bound by this Language Policy Framework.
The increased need for the services of professional language practitioners will require further skills training.
The NLS will also be responsible for coordinating the development of training programmes for translators, editors and interpreters, and establishing operational guidelines on quality issues.
and courses in language practice, translation and editing, interpreting, language planning, terminography and lexicography.
The core of translation expertise in these languages will have to be expanded both in government departments and in the private sector, i.e. freelance language practitioners such as translators, editors and interpreters will have to be developed.
International communication: Government communication at the international level will normally be in English or ad hoc in the preferred language of the country concerned.
The availability of Human Language Technology applications for the indigenous languages will play a major supporting role in language facilitation activities.
intra and interdepartmental oral communication
Regulating the language facilitation profession, i.e. translation, interpreting and terminology development, through development and appropriate legislation;
Working language/language of record: By consensus, each government structure must agree on a working language;
There must be a decentralised and participatory approach to language planning and policy implementation, which harnesses technical expertise for the transfer of knowledge and skills.

It will be necessary to conduct policy reviews at reasonable intervals in order to monitor progress towards a fully multilingual South African society.
2.4.6.2. Communication with members of the public: For official correspondence purposes, the language of the citizens choice must be used.
The size options for language units will be determined and skills training in this area will be prioritised after the number of official languages to be used
Units consisting of four or more professional staff will require clerks.

The NLS will be required to coordinate the management of policy implementation
Local governments will determine the language use and preferences of their communities within an enabling provincial language policy framework.
At least one from the Sotho group;
The progressive phasing in of the implementation of the policy in the short, medium and long term is the preferred strategy at all levels.
The establishment of language units in each national government department and in each province
Facilitating cooperation and the sharing of responsibilities among SADC member states will accelerate language development.
The implementation of the language policy willincrease the demand for translation and editing work and interpreting services, especially in the indigenous languages.
For the purposes of conducting meetings or performing specific tasks every effort

﻿Responding to land invasion
Both state land and privately-owned land can be invaded unlawfully.
Government has a constitutional duty to ensure – where required and within available resources – that all citizens can enjoy their basic rights to access to land and/or to housing.
Where special circumstances such as large-scale invasions occur, government has a similar duty to assist private landowners to protect their land.
Individuals who have no access to agricultural land can approach the Department of Land Affairs for assistance to find suitable agricultural land.
Factors such as the size of the community for which land must be sought and the cost of land in a particular area are taken into account.
The costs involved in obtaining suitable alternative land are case-dependent.
However, due to stakeholder consultation and ministerial approval, the process can take between two and three months to be completed.
Initially, it will take the Directorate: Public Land Support Services approximately 14 days to search for and identify suitable alternative land.
Where private land has been unlawfully invaded and special circumstances exist, the land owner can approach the area's local municipality or, if necessary, the provincial or national Department of Housing for assistance if the underlying need is for housing.
Individuals in need of housing can approach the local municipality or, if necessary, the provincial or national Department of Housing for assistance.
Where private land has been unlawfully invaded and special circumstances exist, the land owner can approach any office of the Department of Land Affairs for assistance if the need that underlies the land invasion is for access to agricultural land.
Where private land has been unlawfully invaded and no special circumstances exist, the land owner must approach the court without delay for an eviction order in terms of the Prevention of Illegal Eviction From and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 1998.

Men have an important role to play in achieving gender equality in South African society.
South Africa is part of several African programmes
Women's representation in the National Assembly has increased to 45.
The Bill of Rights guarantees equal treatment for all South Africans.
Women should participate in lawmaking because the implementation of legislation and government policies has an impact on their daily lives.
Men and women have an equal and significant role to play in the transformation of gender relations in society.
The South African Constitution provides a framework for the promotion of gender equality, and therefore the participation of women in lawmaking.

WHAT ROLE CAN MEN PLAY?
In addition to the provisions made in the Constitution,
These include, among others, the Commission on Gender Equality and the South African Human Rights Commission.
The fourth Parliament has established the following Committees that deal directly with issues relating to women:
HOW WELL ARE WOMEN CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT?
There are many challenges that prevent women from playing a full and meaningful role, and the biggest one is poverty.
Select Committee on Women, Youth, Children and Persons with Disabilities
Poverty is a struggle faced by many South African women, especially rural women.
The Constitution makes provision for institutions that support democracy, as well as for the participation of women.
Produced by Parliamentary Communication Services
There are different ways in which this can be done.
The public has a right to attend committee meetings and to participate in Public Hearings.
The Constitution contains several provisions that advance gender equality.
Despite women constituting the majority of the South African population, women are still in the minority when it comes to decision making.
South Africa has committed to gender equality through its ratification of international conventions
The public can inform a Portfolio or Select Committee of their views or on an issue it is debating.
South Africa has also adopted legislation to specifically address gender equality.
Furthermore, HIV/ AIDS affects a far greater proportion of women, especially young women in their childbearing years.
Our growing democracy has improved women's access to political power and decision-making.
A new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities has also been created
In order for women to fully participate in lawmaking, women's access to basic services should be improved.
No society can be truly emancipated until its women and men are free and equal, and to this end, men and women bear a shared responsibility.
Access to basic services such as education, water and welfare has been influenced by unequal gender, race and class relations.
WOMEN AND PARLIAMENT
The Bill of Rights emphasises that measures must be taken to promote the achievement of equality in all spheres of society.
More importantly, research has shown that when women take part in decision making, it leads to an increased focus and allocation of resources that improve the quality of life of all.
Women can participate in lawmaking by voting for the political party they think can best represent their views and concerns in Parliament.
1 An increase in the participation of women in lawmaking can by extension lead to an improvement in access to basic services such as housing, education and welfare.
Women constitute more than half of the South African population and therefore the voices of women must be included when decisions are taken and laws are made.
The first and most important way women can be involved in Parliament is during elections.
The national election gives all people over the age of 18 the right to vote for the party of their choice.
such as the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Platform of Action, which was established by the Beijing Conference on Women.
The South African Constitution says that there must be public access to and involvement in Parliament and its processes.
LAWMAKING?
The challenge is to make the rights accessible to all women.
The inclusion of women in decision making is a fundamental human right.
Men must influence other men to change attitudes, and to respect women.

The PMP embarked on this project to give voice to the voiceless and to afford women within marginalised communities as well as minority groups an opportunity to engage with one another and the broader Parliamentary community on what Democracy has meant to them.
District Municipalities
Bring communities closer together through this Quilting project by creating opportunities for women to share their views on matters of policy and how it has an impact on their lives.
Stimulate and deepen debate amongst South Africans around issues such as Democracy and Nation Building.
In the same way this project recognises and encourages the diversity of views and opinions amongst South African women, but also encourages them to recognise the interdependence that is necessary for us forging a common future in our quest for unity in diversity.
The publicity campaign will further be supported by strategically placing posters in different public venues across the province.

Through this endeavour different skills and knowledge will be transferred, shared and exchanged, affording the legislatures and local government structures an opportunity to develop their own framework for future projects focussed on nation building.
In addition, a selection of the artworks from each province will be used for the production of a quilt that will be permanently installed in Parliament.
Another important outcome of this project is that an analysis will be done of the stories written by the women and used as submissions to Parliamentary Portfolio Committees.
The concept is based on the approach of selecting random groups of women in targeted geographic areas to write stories about issues and experiences related to their everyday lives.

PROJECT/TASK TEAM
The general public
By initiating this country wide quilting project in collaboration with the Provincial Legislatures and Local Government Structures, we aim to provide an opportunity for South African women to be more visible and demand their rightful place within society.
A harsh reality that South Africans continue to face is the great numbers of women who still find themselves marginalised, poverty stricken and abused and not fully integrated within the support structures of society.
PARLIAMENTARY MILLENNIUM PROGRAMMEROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
It also commits itself to exploring and expressing the relationship between society and creativity wherein women would translate their stories into a work of art.
The thoughts, dreams and aspirations of these women will be shared with other South Africans, as we anticipate that the artwork will be on permanent display in the various Provincial Legislatures, as well as be made available to local communities through exhibitions in public spaces in the provinces.
This project forms part of the Inter Legislature Exchange, a broader collaboration with Legislatures and Local Government structures in each Province .The benefit of this collaboration is that the Provincial and Local Structures will each take ownership of this nation building initiative in their respective province.

These written stories are finally translated into a piece of artwork that is reflective of the personal stories and experiences of these women.

PROGRESS TO DATE:
For these reasons, The Parliamentary Millennium Programme in collaboration with Create Africa South, a Durban based organisation, the Provincial Legislatures and Local Government structures, have embarked on Amazwi Abesifazane, a National Quilting Campaign.
A. Workshop Facilitation/Creative Application - Create Africa South B.
The groups of participating women all attend workshops, facilitated by the facilitators of CAS, and are guided through a process of conceptualisation where they engage with other women and facilitators to discuss their ideas and opinions on how they feel about certain events that have occurred in their lives.
The stories will be clustered into themes, and issues will be extracted from the themes to give a clear impression of the kind of challenges that women in this country continue to confront.
It affords the PMP, the Legislatures and Local Government the opportunity to broaden the scope and reach of projects aimed at making South Africans aware of issues related to nation building and the deepening of our democracy.

PROGRESS TO DATE:
This quilting campaign is therefore of utmost importance as inputs given by the women will be fed through the policy making process.
The preparation phase for the installation of Provincial Exhibitions is underway and the submissions are in the final drafting phases.
Four workshops have been completed.
District Municipalities
This project forms part of the Inter Legislature Exchange, a broader collaboration with Legislatures and Local Government structures in each Province.
Another important outcome of this project is that an analysis will be done of the stories written by the women and used as submissions to Parliamentary Portfolio Committees.
The stories will be clustered into themes, and issues will be extracted from the themes to give a clear impression of the kind of challenges that women in this country continue to confront.
affording the legislatures and local government structures an opportunity to develop their own framework for future projects focussed on nation building.
The thoughts, dreams and aspirations of these women will be shared with other South Africans,
